1. Set Up User Authentication with Amazon Cognito
Goal: Securely manage user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the collaborative editor.
Steps:
Create a Cognito User Pool:
Go to the Cognito section in the AWS Console and create a new User Pool for managing user sign-up and sign-in.
Customize the User Pool settings (password policies, MFA, etc.), and enable social or custom login methods if needed.
Create an App Client:
In the User Pool, create an App Client (no client secret for web applications) to integrate with your frontend application.
Note the App Client ID for integration purposes.
Create an Identity Pool (optional):
If you need users to access other AWS resources, such as S3 or DynamoDB, create an Identity Pool and link it to the User Pool for authorized access.
This allows you to assign temporary AWS credentials to authenticated users.
Authentication Flow:
Implement user sign-up and sign-in functionality in your frontend (using AWS Amplify or directly with Cognito APIs).
Upon successful login, users receive a JWT token, which they will use to authenticate API calls.

2. Set Up AppSync for Real-Time Communication
Goal: Use AWS AppSync to provide real-time updates and sync changes between users as they work on the code.
Steps:
Create an AppSync API:
In the AppSync section, create a new API and define a schema for real-time collaborative editing.
The schema should support the following:
A mutation for submitting changes to the code.
A subscription for notifying all users about updates in real-time.
Set Up Data Sources:
Use DynamoDB as the data source for storing and retrieving the code content.
Set up resolvers in AppSync to connect your mutations and subscriptions to DynamoDB and trigger updates.
Define the GraphQL Schema:
The schema should include operations like:
submitChange: To allow users to submit their code changes.
onCodeChange: A subscription to push real-time updates to clients when changes are made.
getCurrentCode: A query to fetch the current code for all users.
Enable Real-Time Sync:
Use AppSync subscriptions to notify all connected users about changes in the code in real-time.

3. Set Up DynamoDB for Code Storage
Goal: Store the collaborative code in DynamoDB to track changes and sync the code among users.
Steps:
Create a DynamoDB Table:
Create a table (e.g., CollaborativeCode) to store the code document.
Primary Key: codeId (String) — Unique identifier for each document.
Attributes:
codeContent (String) — Holds the code.
lastModifiedBy (String) — Tracks the last user who modified the code.
timestamp (String) — Timestamp of the last change.
Set Up Access Control:
Use IAM roles and Cognito to control access to the DynamoDB table, ensuring that only authenticated users can update and retrieve the code.

4. Set Up API Gateway and Lambda for Backend Logic
Goal: Use API Gateway and Lambda to manage additional logic, such as user validation or handling more complex operations not handled by AppSync.
Steps:
Create API Gateway:
Create a REST API to handle operations such as saving drafts or querying the document history (if needed).
Secure the API using Cognito as the authorizer to ensure only authenticated users can call the endpoints.
Create Lambda Functions:
Implement the following Lambda functions:
Save Draft: Save a version of the code to S3 (or DynamoDB) as a backup.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const { codeId, codeContent, userId } = JSON.parse(event.body); // Extract values from the API request body

    // Create a unique draft ID based on the timestamp
    const draftId = `${codeId}-draft-${Date.now()}`;
    
    // Save to DynamoDB
    const dynamoParams = {
        TableName: 'CodeDrafts', // Assuming DynamoDB table 'CodeDrafts' exists
        Item: {
            draftId: draftId,
            codeId: codeId,
            userId: userId,
            codeContent: codeContent,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        }
    };

    try {
        // Save to DynamoDB (for version control)
        await dynamodb.put(dynamoParams).promise();
        
        // Optionally, save to S3 (Backup version)
        const s3Params = {
            Bucket: 'your-s3-bucket-name',  // Replace with your bucket name
            Key: `drafts/${codeId}/${draftId}.txt`,
            Body: codeContent,
            ContentType: 'text/plain',
        };
        await s3.putObject(s3Params).promise();

        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({
                message: 'Draft saved successfully',
                draftId: draftId
            })
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error saving draft:", error);
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ error: error.message })
        };
    }
};
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Get Document History: Retrieve the history of changes to the code (if version control is needed).
--------------------------------------------------------------------
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const { codeId } = event.pathParameters;  // Get codeId from the path parameters in API Gateway

    // Query DynamoDB for all history entries of the specified codeId
    const params = {
        TableName: 'CodeHistory', // Assuming DynamoDB table 'CodeHistory' exists
        KeyConditionExpression: 'codeId = :codeId',
        ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ':codeId': codeId
        }
    };

    try {
        const result = await dynamodb.query(params).promise();

        if (result.Items.length === 0) {
            return {
                statusCode: 404,
                body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'No history found for this codeId' })
            };
        }

        // Return the history as an array of documents
        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({
                history: result.Items
            })
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error retrieving history:", error);
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ error: error.message })
        };
    }
};

--------------------------------------------------------------------
These functions can be invoked via API Gateway.


5. Set Up S3 for File Storage (Optional)
Goal: Use S3 for file storage if users need to upload files or export the code.
Steps:
Create an S3 Bucket:
In the S3 section, create a bucket to store code files or backups.
Integrate with Lambda:
If users need to export their code or save versions, configure Lambda functions to upload/download files to/from S3.
Set up proper permissions so that only authenticated users can access their files.

6. Set Up Frontend Application
Goal: Build a web application that integrates with the backend services and allows users to collaboratively edit code.
Steps:
Frontend Application:
Build a frontend using JavaScript (e.g., React or Angular) that communicates with the AppSync API.
Use AWS Amplify for easy integration with Cognito, AppSync, and other AWS services.
Real-Time Updates:
Use AppSync subscriptions in the frontend to listen for real-time code changes.
Update the editor UI whenever a change is made by any user, reflecting the real-time collaboration experience.
Code Editing:
Implement a code editor (e.g., using Monaco Editor or CodeMirror) to allow users to edit the code.
When a user types or modifies the code, submit those changes through the submitChange mutation.
Authentication:
Use Cognito to authenticate users and manage their session.
Upon login, retrieve the user's credentials and store the JWT token for API calls.

7. Test and Optimize
Steps:
Test Real-Time Collaboration:
Test that multiple users can edit the same code simultaneously and that changes are reflected in real time.
Ensure that AppSync subscriptions work properly to broadcast changes to all connected users.
Optimize Performance:
Use DynamoDB streams for real-time data changes (if applicable).
Optimize the use of AppSync to handle multiple users and large code changes efficiently.
Secure the Application:
Make sure the Cognito authentication and authorization flows are correctly implemented.
Use IAM roles to restrict access to sensitive resources (e.g., DynamoDB, S3).
